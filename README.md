This is a simple Godot 4 project with the additional Gradle parts necessary to build and run scripts written in either Kotlin or Java.
It will simply display text on screen written by the 2 unique Kotlin and Java source files.



To use it, simply download the Godot Kotlin/JVM custom engine here: 
https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm/releases

 Then build the project, like you would with any other Kotlin project to generate a .jar. It will be picked up automatically by the engine. 
Make sure that the engine version defined the gradle.build file matches the one you downloaded.
